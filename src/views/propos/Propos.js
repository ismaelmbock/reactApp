                                        <p>Maramani Limited is an International Business Company (Company No.: 162961) incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles. Reach us by Phone / WhatsApp +1 307 461 9111<br /><br />We specialize in all types of home plans where you can instantly download complete drawing sets directly to your computer.

                                        <h2 className="text-primary">Quelles sont nos activités?</h2>
                                        <p>Well, all designs have been designed for clients based on their specific requirements - this means that any drawing sold here has already paid itself back by the time you get to download it. So in a way you can say we are recycling the designs. And yes, it is legal. All copyrights belong to the architects who designed the buildings, otherwise we would not be selling the drawings. For in-house designs we negotiate with our clients and only publish designs that we have full rights to.</p>

                                        <p>PDF is a standard format for many types of documents including drawings which can be printed without loss in quality. The files can be viewed on any computer or smart phone but the files cannot be edited. DWG is a standard format used by many different types of computer design software such AutoCad. The files can be edited and changes can be made easily to the plans by anyone who knows how to use the software. When you purchase a plan we include both the PDF and DWG files for your convenience in case you want to make small adjustments on your own. Yeah, and also because we're really nice people :-)</p>
                                        <h2 className="text-primary">Que pouvons nous réaliser dans la vie réelles?</h2>
                                        <p>Structural drawings are those drawings which show steel reinforcements and other boring stuff that the builder has to consider when building your house. Not all designs have these drawings but not all designs need these drawings either. If it happens that the design you like needs but does not have Structural drawings you can order them from us for and they will be ready within 5 - 7 working days. Please contact us or your local builder if you need any assistance on this matter.</p>

                                        <p>We also offer the option of ordering custom made drawings designed to your exact requirements. Drop us an email of your requirements and we’ll get back to you within 24 hours with a price quotation.</p>
